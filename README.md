Note: I was not able to get the nasa jpeg to pull through, so I added a background color instead.

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

### Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

If anybody is interested in UFO's, they can go to this webpage and look at UFO sightings and their details all over the United States. If someone is interested to learn where there have been UFO sightings in their state, they can type into the state filter box "tx" for example, then press enter. As seen below, the table will then filter for all sightings that have occured in the states of Texas.

### Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One drawback is that someone cannot see all UFO sighting data in a particular time period, only by one date at a timne. If they had a date range filter to see all sightings within a particular year, for example. The next drawback is that someone is not able to sort the data. Someone may want to sort by most recent sightings, which would require a sort button on the date header.
